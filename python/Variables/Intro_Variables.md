Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
Almost every thing we can do in python (powerful)

Reason for increasing popularity

    Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing
    Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.
    Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
    There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
    Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.

LANGUAGE FEATURES

    Interpreted
        There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
        Directly run the program from the source code.
        Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
        No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
    Platform Independent
        Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
        Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.
    Free and Open Source; Redistributable
    High-level Language
        In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
    Simple
        Closer to English language;Easy to Learn
        More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
    Embeddable
        Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
    Robust:
        Exceptional handling features
        Memory management techniques in built
    Rich Library Support
        The Python Standard Library is very vast.
        Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
        Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.

Easy - learn, Maintain - Beautify code in a simple way

Variable = Example

a = 3
b=4.5
c="sai"
d= 5 +6j
g=True

(a = 4

a,b,c = 1,"Sai",True

a,b,c = 1,True -- Error

x = "eswar"
x+4

True + True

True - False

1 + True

input()

a = input() #returns str always

if u want to convert to int the
b= 6

a+b => error , so convert -> int(a)
